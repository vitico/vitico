# Hey there, I'm Vitico! 👾

Welcome to my corner of GitHub, where **code meets creativity** and just about anything can happen.  
I’m a web developer with a love for all things tech—if it blinks, clicks, or beeps, I’ve probably tinkered with it!

- 🤖 **Automation enthusiast** (why do things manually when you can automate?)
- 🌐 **Built a super-cool automaton** for scanning multiple web apps at once!
- 🔌 **IoT/Arduino explorer**—wires, sensors, and little blinking LEDs are my jam
- 🎲 **Gamer at heart** (and in code—game automation is a hobby!)

- And probably whatever you’ll ask me about next week!

## 🌟 Project Spotlight

**Automaton for Scanning Multiple Web Apps**  
I built a crafty tool to automate the scanning and management of tons of web apps. Because life’s too short for one-at-a-time!

## 🎮 When I’m Not Coding...

You’ll probably find me:
- Leveling up in my favorite games 🎮
